At the foot of the mountain
The top seems out of sight

Burn
I wanna burn inside
Where's the next wall I can raze?

I can raze

Try, try to eraze a life
Equalized and fairly safe

This is my way...
The marvel of chimera
There is light behind
The darkness of your days

I will die with a name
So what do you die for?

The marvel of chimera
The fire in your heart
Devours your shoulders weight

I will die with a name
So what do you die for?

The further you climb
The more you see the light

Am I faithless?
How can I believe?
This is my only life

Only life

Driven by an inner flame
I am struggling to survive

This is my way
The marvel of chimera

With this fire I will burn
My hell

There is light behind
The darkness of your days

I will die with a name

The marvel of chimera

Nothings gonna stop me now

The fire in your heart
Devours your shoulders weight

I will die with a name
So what do you die for?
So what do you die for?

Leave it all behind
This is your place and time
A laurel wreath
Nailed to your cross
When you step into the light
Of the world

This is my way
The marvel of chimera

With this fire I will burn
My hell

There is light behind
The darkness of your days

I will die with a name
So what do you die for?

The marvel of chimera

Nothings gonna stop me now

The fire in your heart
Devours your shoulders weight

I will die with a name
So what do you die for?

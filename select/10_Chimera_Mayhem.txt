What can be seen in the rear view mirror, expectancy was a Mephisto's gasp
Your past was never quite there, there was nothing that loose in the
Constituents of your substance, it does indeed exist in parts of your neural
Commitments to the mind body, Or does evil exist?
There was always something paranoid in the ways she behaved in your guilt
Conclusions are never to be trusted!
You are not dead, you never existed...
You are not dead
Her devotees were never that pure, pure existence was never arbitrary

Not in my convictions of the truth, she gave the demon seeds life
The necessity of the game given, displayed a virtue unseen in you
There is gangrene in the tubes

Of the vermicular ethics of how your world view presents itself
Contradictions in terms of how, your life evolves in the chain of being

I claim you were never a part of reality
This is where your life lie grows pale, never known to your mirror self

She was a creature alive in you
But I put my hand through the...
"Hell was never an option for you, Luciferian tolerance yields the given
Your dissolving truth tables"
You are not dead, you never existed
"The sum of all you ever knew equals zero" You are not dead, you never
Existed
You are not dead, you never existed...
You are not dead, you never existed...

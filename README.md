Ooh
Ah
Lalalananananana
Oh no～
Fell into the abyss unknown
Left me bleedin',
heartless all alone
No control
Dontcha dare apologize
[Ayayaya]
Turn my back and
felt a cold knife
[Ayayaya]
Listen up
cause here's some advice-uh
[Ayayaya]
You outta time
way outta line
It's taking over,
like a renegade
eye for an eye,
I'll make you cry
[Cry!]
Tearin' it down
Do just what I wanna
Keep callin' me a sinner
[Know ya think so]
Chimera
[Got me twisted]
Chimera
[Such a misfit]
Takin' the crown
Now you're callin me king
You gonna hear em all sing
[Now sing it]
Chimera
[Louder like that]
Chimera
Make em all [Ah]
Don't back it up
Don't back it up
Keep that aim
I got thoughts
that'll drive you insane
Come over if you like
[Uh-huh]
We'll have a lot of fun
but I got a lot of bite
Haha HOO
I do what I want
Make sure you don't forget it
An army on my back
Say I'm sick, I'm just sadistic
Not livin' in a lie [huh]
Pariah in the light [yuh]
I wanna see the way you bleed
[Way you bleed～]
It's taking over,
like a renegade
Eye for an eye,
I'll make you cry
[Cry!]
Tearin' it down
Do just what I wanna
Keep callin' me a sinner
[Know ya think so]
Chimera
[Got me twisted]
Chimera
[Such a misfit]
Takin' the crown
Now you're callin' me king
You gonna hear em all sing
[Now sing it]
Chimera
[Louder like that]
Chimera
Make em all [Ah]
I want it all
So gimme some more
Flames burnt me up
down into my core
Oh You wished I'd stay down
but then I just rise
You're not my enemy
Baby you're dead to me
Hear my voices
screaming out loud, no doubt
Yeah!
Yeah～
Lalala
Chimera
Lalala
Chimera
Tearin' it down
Do just what I wanna
Keep callin' me a sinner
[Know ya think so]
Chimera
[Got me twisted]
Chimera
[Such a misfit]
Takin' the crown
Now you're callin me king
You gonna hear em all sing
[Now sing it]
Chimera
[Louder like that]
Chimera
Make em all ah～
Lalala
Chimera
Lalala
[Yeah～]
Chimera
